# Internship E-commerce Website Prototype
## Project Description
This project is a full-featured e-commerce website prototype developed during an internship to simulate real-world online shopping workflows and UI/UX patterns. The application showcases a dynamic product catalog, interactive shopping features, and a modular codebase, implemented using standard web technologies and a JavaScript framework. It also leverages MongoDB for data management, providing a solid demonstration of a modern, scalable e-commerce solution.​

## Main Purpose
The main purpose of this project is to demonstrate practical web development skills, including frontend design, dynamic content handling, and backend integration, suited for internships, student portfolios, or recruitable software engineering roles. The application can be used as a teaching tool, a base for custom retail solutions, or a showcase of foundational e-commerce concepts.​

## Features
### -> Responsive, multi-page UI with product galleries and details.​

### -> Modular CSS, JS, and media asset management.

### -> Integrated MongoDB database for dynamic data storage.

### -> CRUD operations for products and users (where applicable).

### -> Video and image galleries for products and marketing.

### -> Ready-to-extend with additional features (cart, checkout, authentication, etc.).

## Technologies Used
